* platform-specific mods to minimal-x86.spt

* gnu c labels do not have an underscore prefix
	c.out = ''

* number of statements within which a jump will be shortened.  derived
* empirically as follows for a specific minimal program:
*
* set jump_n to a large value, then translate and assemble program.
* the assembler will report a large number of jumps out of range.
* reduce jump_n until the number of errors is small (<10), and enter
* those as special cases below.
*
* these definitions are for minimal file v37.min and the 80386 code generator.
