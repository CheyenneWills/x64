This is the "bootstrap" version of SPITBOL.

It was built using a 32-bit X86 processor on the 32-bit version of Linux Mint v13.

The file ./bootstrap/spitbol contains a statically linked SPITBOL executable that can be run on a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux system.

Note that this bootstrap compiler does NOT support floating point. It is meant for bootstrapping, not production use.
