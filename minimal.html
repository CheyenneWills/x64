The following sections describe the implementation
       language originally developed for spitbol but now more
       widely used. minimal is an assembly language
       for an idealized machine. the following describes the
       basic characteristics of this machine.
 
<h2>section 1 - configuration parameters</h2>

<p>Tthere are several parameters which may vary with the
       target machine. the macro-program is independent of the
       actual definitions of these parameters.
 <p>The definitions of these parameters are supplied by
       the translation program to match the target machine.
 <dl>
<dt><code>cfp$a</code>
<dd>number of distinct characters in
                             internal alphabet in the range

<dd>number of bytes in a word where a byte is the amount of storage
addressed by the least significant address bit.  </dl>

</pre>

<h2>section 2 - memory</h2>

<p>
Memory is organized into words which each contain <code>cfp$b</code>
       bytes. for word machines <code>cfp$b</code>, which is a configuration
       parameter, may be one in which case words and bytes are
       identical. to each word corresponds an address which is
       a non-negative quantity which is a multiple of <code>cfp$b</code>.
       data is organized into words as follows.
 
<ol>
<li>a signed integer value occupies <code>cfp$i</code> consecutive
            words (<code>cfp$i</code> is a configuration parameter).
            the range may include more negative numbers than
            positive (e.g. the twos complement representation).
 
<li>a signed real value occupies <code>cfp$r</code> consecutive
            words. (<code>cfp$r</code> is a configuration parameter).
<li><code>cfp$c</code> characters may be stored in a single word
            (<code>cfp$c</code> is a configuration parameter).
 
<li>a bit string containing <code>cfp$n</code> bits can be stored in
            a single word (<code>cfp$n</code> is a configuration parameter).
 
<li>a word can contain a unsigned integer value in
            the range (0 le n le <code>cfp$l</code>. These integer values
            may represent addresses of other words and some of
            the instructions use this fact to provide indexing
            and indirection facilities.
<li>program instructions occupy words in an undefined
            manner. depending on the actual implementation,
            instructions may occupy several words, or part of
            a word, or even be split over word boundaries.
 
</ol>
</pre>

<p>The following regions of memory are available to the
       program. each region consists of a series of words with
       consecutive addresses.
 
<ol>
<li>constant section ---            assembled constants
<li> working storage section ---    assembled work areas
<li>program section ---            assembled instructions
<li>stack area ---                 allocated stack area
<li>data area ---                  allocated data area
</ol>
 
<h2>section 3 - registers</h2>
 
<p>There are three index registers called <code>XR</code>,<code>XL</code>,<code>XS</code>. in
       addition <code>XL</code> may sometimes be referred to by the alias
       of xt - see section 4. any of the above registers
       may hold a positive unsigned integer in the range
       (0 le n le <code>cfp$l</em). when the index register is used for
       indexing purposes, this must be an appropriate address.
       <code>XS</code> is special in that it is used to point to the top
       item of a stack in memory. the stack may build up or
       down in memory.since it is required that <code>XS</code> points to the
       stack top but access to items below the top is permitted,
       registers <code>XS</code> and xt may be used with suitable offsets
       to index stacked items. only <code>XS</code> and xt may be used for
       this purpose since the direction of the offset is
       target machine dependent. xt is a synonym for <code>XL</code>
       which therefore cannot be used in code sequences
       referencing xt.
<p> 
       the stack is used for s-r linkage and temporary
       data storage for which the stack arrangement is suitable.
       <code>XR</code>,<code>XL</code> can also contain a character pointer in conjunction
       with the character instructions (see description of plc).
       ejc
<p> 
       there are three work registers called wa,<code>WB</code>,<code>WC</code> which
       can contain any data item which can be stored in a
       single memory word. in fact, the work registers are just
       like memory locations except that they have no addresses
       and are referenced in a special way by the instructions.
<p> 
       note that registers wa,<code>WB</code> have special uses in connection
       with the cvd, cvm, mvc, mvw, m<code>WB</code>, cmc, trc instructions.
<p> 
       register <code>WC</code> may overlap the integer accumulator (<code>IA</code>) in
       some implementations. thus any operation changing the
       value in <code>WC</code> leaves (<code>IA</code>) undefined and vice versa
       except as noted in the following restriction on simple
       dump/restore operations.
<p> 
<pre>
           restriction
           -----------
 
       if <code>IA</code> and <code>WC</code> overlap then
           sti  iasav
           ldi  iasav
       does not change <code>WC</code>, and
           mov  <code>WC</code>,<code>WC</code>sav
           mov  <code>WC</code>sav,<code>WC</code>
       does not change <code>IA</code>.
</pre> 
 
<p> 
       there is an integer accumulator (<code>IA</code>) which is capable of
       holding a signed integer value (<code>cfp$i</code> words long).
       register <code>WC</code> may overlap the integer accumulator (<code>IA</code>) in
       some implementations. thus any operation changing the
       value in <code>WC</code> leaves (<code>IA</code>) undefined and vice versa
       except as noted in the above restriction on simple
       dump/restore operations.
 
<p> 
 
       there is a single real accumulator (<code>RA</code>) which can hold
       any real value and is completely separate from any of
       the other registers or program accessible locations.
 
 
<p> 
       the code pointer register (<code>CP</code>) is a special index
       register for use in implementations of interpretors.
       it is used to contain a pseudo-code pointer and can
       only be affected by i<code>CP</code>, l<code>CP</code>, s<code>CP</code> and lcw instructions.

<h2>section 4 - the stack</h2>
<p> 
       the following notes are to guide both implementors of
       systems written in minimal and minimal programmers in
       dealing with stack manipulation. implementation of a
       downwards building stack is easiest and in general is
       to be preferred, in which case it is merely necessary to
       consider xt as an alternative name for <code>XL</code>.
<p> 
       the minimal virtual machine includes a stack and has
       operand formats -(<code>XS</code>) and (<code>XS</code>)+ for pushing and popping
       items with an implication that the stack builds down in
       memory (a d-stack). however on some target machines it is
       better for the stack to build up (a u-stack).
       a stack addressed only by push and pop operations can
       build in either direction with no complication but
       such a pure scheme of stack access proves restrictive.
       hence it is permitted to access buried items using an
       integer offset past the index register pointing to the
       stack top. on target machines this offset will be
       positive/negative for d-stacks/u-stacks and this must
       be allowed for in the translation.
       a further restriction is that at no time may an item be
       placed above the stack top. for some operations this
       makes it convenient to advance the stack pointer and then
       address items below it using a second index register.
       the problem of signed offsets past such a register then
       arises. to distinguish stack offsets, which in some
       implementations may be negative, from non-stack offsets
       which are invariably positive, xt, an alias or
       synonym for <code>XL</code> is used. for a u-stack implementation, the
       minimal translator should negate the sign of offsets
       applied to both (<code>XS</code>) and (xt).
       programmers should note that since xt is not a
       separate register, <code>XL</code> should not be used in code where
       xt is referenced. other modifications needed in u-stack
       translations are in the add, sub, ica, dca opcodes
       applied to <code>XS</code>, xt. for example
<pre> 
       minimal           d-stack trans.  u-stack trans.
 
       mov  wa,-(<code>XS</code>)     sbi  <code>XS</code>,1       adi  <code>XS</code>,1
                         sto  wa,(<code>XS</code>)    sto  wa,(<code>XS</code>)
       mov  (xt)+,<code>WC</code>     lod  <code>WC</code>,(<code>XL</code>)    lod  <code>WC</code>,(<code>XL</code>)
                         adi  <code>XL</code>,1       sbi  <code>XL</code>,1
       add  =seven,<code>XS</code>    adi  <code>XS</code>,7       sbi  <code>XS</code>,7
       mov  2(xt),wa     lod  wa,2(<code>XL</code>)   lod  wa,-2(<code>XL</code>)
       ica  <code>XS</code>           adi  <code>XS</code>,1       sbi  <code>XS</code>,1
 
       note that forms such as
       mov  -(<code>XS</code>),wa
       add  wa,(<code>XS</code>)+
       are illegal, since they assume information storage
       above the stack top.
</pre>
<h2>section 5 - internal character set</h2>
<p>The internal character set is represented by a set of
       contiguous codes from 0 to <code>cfp$a</code>-1. the codes for the
       digits 0-9 must be contiguous and in sequence. other
       than this, there are no restraints.
<p> 
       the following symbols are automatically defined to have
       the value of the corresponding internal character code.
<pre> 
       ch$la                 letter a

<p>The following optional symbols are incorporated
       by defining the conditional assembly symbol named.

       ch$ey                 up arrow       - define .caex
</pre>
 
<h2>section 6 - conditional assembly features</h2>

<p>Some features of the interpreter are applicable to only
       certain target machines. they may be incorporated or
       omitted by use of conditional assembly. the full
       form of a condition is -
<pre>
       .if    conditional assembly symbol    (cas)
       .then
              minimal statements1   (ms1)
       .else
              minimal statements2   (ms2)
       .fi
</pre>
       the following rules apply

<ol>
   <li>the directives .if, .then, .else, .fi must
            start in column 1.
       <li>The conditional assembly symbol must start with a
            dot in column 8 followed by 4 letters or digits e.g.
<pre>
               .ca$1
</pre>
       <li>.then is redundant and may be omitted if wished.
<li>ms1, ms2 are arbitrary sequences of minimal
            statements either of which may be null or may
            contain further conditions.
<li>if ms2 is omitted, .else may also be omitted.
<li>.fi is required.
<li>conditions may be nested to a depth determined
            by the translator (not less than 20, say).
</ol> 
<pr>
       selection of the alternatives ms1, ms2 is by means of the
       define and undefine directives of form -
<pre>
       .def   cas
       .undef cas
</pre>
<p>
       which obey rules 1. and 2. above and may occur at any
       point in a minimal program, including within a condition.
       multiply defining a symbol is an error.
       undefining a symbol which is not defined is not an error.
<p> 
       the effect is that if a symbol is currently defined,
       then in any condition depending on it, ms1 will be
       processed and ms2 omitted. conversely if it is undefined,
       ms1 will be omitted and ms2 processed.
<p> 
       nesting of conditions is such that conditions
       in a section not selected for processing must not be
       evaluated. nested conditions must remember their
       environment whilst being processed. effectively this
       implies use of a scheme based on a stack with .if, .fi
       matching by the condition processor of the translator.
       ejc
 
  <h2>section 7 - operand formats</h2>
<p> 
       the following section describes the various possibilities
       for operands of instructions and assembly operations.
<pre>

</pre> 
<p>
       the numbers in the above list are used in subsequent
       description and in some of the minimal translators.
<p> 
       operand formats (continued)
<p> 
       the following special symbols refer to a collection of
       the listed possibilities
<dl>
<dt>       val  01,02 

<dd>predefined value
 
<p>
            val is used to refer to a predefined one word
            integer value in the range 0 le n le <code>cfp$l</em.
 
<dt>reg  07,08

<dd>register
 
<p>
            reg is used to describe an operand which can be
            any of the registers (<code>XL</code>,<code>XR</code>,<code>XS</code>,xt,wa,<code>WB</code>,<code>WC</code>). such
            an operand can hold a one word integer (address).
 
<dt>opc  09,10,11
<dd>                   character
 
<p>
            opc is used to designate a specific character
            operand for use in the lch and sch instructions.
            the index register referenced must be either <code>XR</code> or
            <code>XL</code> (not <code>XS</code>,xt). see section on character operations.
 
<dt>ops  03,04,09,12,13,14,15

<dd>       memory reference
 
<p>
            ops is used to describe an operand which is in
            memory. the operand may be one or more words long
            depending on the data type. in the case of multiword
            operands, the address given is the first word.
 
<dt>opw  as for ops + 08,10,11

<dd>      full word
 
<p>
            opw is used to refer to an operand whose capacity is
            that of a full memory word. opw includes all the
            possibilities for ops (the referenced word is used)
            plus the use of one of the three work registers
            (wa,<code>WB</code>,<code>WC</code>). in addition, the formats (x)+ and -(x)
            allow indexed operations in which the index register
            is popped by one word after the reference (x)+,
            or pushed by one word before the reference -(x)
            these latter two formats provide a facility for
            manipulation of stacks. the format does not imply
            a particular direction in which stacks must build -
            it is used for compactness. note that there is a
            restriction which disallows an instruction to use
            an index register in one of these formats
            in some other manner in the same instruction.
            e.g.   mov  <code>XL</code>,(<code>XL</code>)+   is illegal.
            the formats -(x) and (x)+ may also be used in
            pre-decrementation, post-incrementation to access
            the adjacent character of a string.
<dt>opn  as for opw + 07

<dd>            one word integer
 
<p>
            opn is used to represent an operand location which
            can contain a one word integer (e.g. an address).
            this includes all the possibilities for opw plus
            the use of one of the index registers (<code>XL</code>,<code>XR</code>,xt,
            <code>XS</code>). the range of integer values is 0 le n le <code>cfp$l</em.
 
<dt>opv  as for opn + 18-22

<dd>         one word integer value
<p> 
            opv is used for an operand which can yield a one
            word integer value (e.g. an address). it includes
            all the possibilities for opn (the current value of
            the location is used) plus the use of literals. note
            that although the literal formats are described in
            terms of a reference to a location containing an
            address constant, this location may not actually
            exist in some implementations since only the value
            is required. a restriction is placed on literals
            which may consist only of defined symbols and
            certain labels. consequently small integers to be
            used as literals must be pre-defined, a discipline
            aiding program maintenance and revision.
 
<dt>addr 01,02,03,04,05

<dd>             address
<p> 
            addr is used to describe an explicit address value
            (one word integer value) for use with dac.

<h3>1-  basic instruction set</h3>
 
<dl>1.1  <br>mov  opv,opn

<dd>     move one word value
<p>
 
            mov causes the value of operand opv to be set as
            the new contents of operand location opn. in the
            case where opn is not an index register, any value
            which can normally occupy a memory word (including
            a part of a multiword real or integer value)
            can be transferred using mov. if the target location
            opn is an index register, then opv must specify an
            appropriate one word value or operand containing
            such an appropriate value.
<dt> 1.2  brn  plbl

<dd>        unconditional branch

            brn causes control to be passed to the indicated
            label in the program section.
<dt>1.3  bsw  x,val,plbl

branch on switch value
<dt> 1.4  iff  val,plbl 
<dd>provide branch for switch

            ...
            ...
</pre>
<dt>1.5  esw 
<dd>end of branch switch table
<p>
 
            bsw,iff,esw provide a capability for a switched
            branch similar to a fortran computed goto. the
            val on the bsw instruction is the maximum number
            of branches. the value in x ranges from zero up to
            but not including this maximum. each iff provides a
            branch. val must be less than that given on the bsw
            and control goes to plbl if the value in x matches.
            if the value in x does not correspond to any of the
            iff entries, then control passes to the plbl on the
            bsw. this plbl operand may be omitted if there are
            no values missing from the list.
<p>
 
            iff and esw may only be used in this context.
            execution of bsw may destroy the contents of x.
            the iff entries may be in any order and since
            a translator may thus need to store and sort them,
            the comment field is restricted in length (sec 11).
<dt>1.6  ent  val
<dd>define program entry point
<p>
            the symbol appearing in the label field is defined
            to be a program entry point which can subsequently
            be used in conjunction with the bri instruction,
            which provides the only means of entering the
            code. it is illegal to fall into code
            identified by an entry point. the
            entry symbol is assigned an address which need not
            be a multiple of <code>cfp$b</code> but which must be in the
            range 0 le <code>cfp$l</em and the address must not lie within
            the address range of the allocated data area.
            furthermore, addresses of successive entry points
            must be assigned in some ascending sequence so
            that the address comparison instructions can be
            used to test the order in which two entry points
            occur. the symbol val gives an identifying value
            to the entry point which can be accessed with the
            lei instruction.
<p> 
            note - subject to the restriction below, val may
            be omitted if no such identification is needed i.e.
            if no lei references the entry point. for this
            case, a translation optimisation is possible in
            which no memory need be reserved for a null
            identification which is never to be referenced, but
            only provided this is done so as not to interfere
            with the strictly ascending sequence of entry point
            addresses. to simplify this optimisation for all
            implementors, the following restriction is observed
<blockquote>
                 val may only be omitted if the entry point is
                 separated from a following entry point by a
                 non-null minimal code sequence.
<blockquote>
<p>
            entry point addresses are accessible only by use of
            literals (=elbl, section 7) or dac constants
            (section 8-11.1).
<dt>1.7  bri  opn

<dd>         branch indirect
<p> 
            opn contains the address of a program entry point
            (see ent). control is passed to the executable
            code starting at the entry point address. opn is
            left unchanged.
 
<dt>1.8  lei  x

<dd>           load entry point identification
<p>
 
            x contains the address of an entry point for which
            an identifying value was given on the the ent line.
            lei replaces the contents of x by this value.
<dt>1.9  jsr  pnam 

<dd>       call procedure pnam
<dt>1.10 ppm  plbl

<dd>        provide exit parameter
<pre>
            ppm  plbl         ...
            ...
            ppm  plbl         ...
</pre>
<p>
 
            jsr causes control to be passed to the named
            procedure. pnam is the label on a prc statement
            elsewhere in the program section (see prc)
            or has been defined using an exp instruction.
            the ppm exit parameters following the call give
            names of program locations (plbl-s) to which
            alternative exi returns of the called procedure may
            pass control. they may optionally be replaced by
            error returns (see err). the number of exit
            parameters following a jsr must equal the int in the
            procedure definition. the operand of ppm may be
            omitted if the corresponding exi return is certain
            not to be taken.
<dt>1.11 prc  ptyp,int
<dd>    define start of procedure
<p>
 
            the symbol appearing in the label field is defined
            to be the name of a procedure for use with jsr.
            a procedure is a contiguous section of instructions
            to which control may be passed with a jsr
            instruction. this is the only way in which the
            instructions in a procedure may be executed. it is
            not permitted to fall into a procedure.
            all procedures should be named in section 0
            inp  statements.
 
<p>
            int is the number of exit parameters (ppm-s) to
            be used in jsr calls.
 
<p>
            there are three possibilities for ptyp, each
            consisting of a single letter as follows.

            the return point is to be stored either
            (1) in a local storage word associated
            with the procedure and not directly
            available to the program in any other manner or
            (2) on a subroutine link stack quite distinct from

            it is an error to use the stack for n-links, since
            procedure parameters or results may be passed via
            the stack.
<p>
            if method (2) is used for links, error exits
            (erb,err) from a procedure will necessitate link
            stack resetting. the ssl and sss orders provided
            for this may be regarded as no-ops for
            implementations using method (1).

            the return point may be stored in either manner
            according to efficiency requirements of the actual
            physical machine used for the implementation. note
            that programming of e type procedures must be
            independent of the actual implementation.
 
<p>
            the actual form of the return point is undefined.
            however, each word stored on the stack for an

<dt>1.12 exi  int

<dd>         exit from procedure
<p>
 
            the ppm and err parameters following a jsr are
            numbered starting from 1.  exi  int causes control
            to be returned to the int-th such param. exi 1 gives
            control to the plbl of the first ppm after the jsr.
            if int is omitted, control is passed back past the
            last exit parameter (or past the jsr if there are
            none). for r and e type procedures, the
            stack pointer <code>XS</code> must be set to its appropriate
            entry value before executing an exi instruction.
            in this case, exi removes return points from the
            stack if any are stored there so that the stack
            pointer is restored to its calling value.
 
<dt>1.13 enp

<dd>              define end of procedure body
<p>
 
            enp delimits a procedure body and may not actually
            be executed, hence it must have no label.
 
<dt>1.14 err  int,text

<dd>    provide error return
<p>
 
            err may replace an exit parameter (ppm) in
            any procedure call. the int argument is a unique
            error code in 0 to 899.
            the text supplied as the other operand is
            arbitrary text in the fortran character set and
            may be used in constructing a file of error
            messages for documenting purposes or for building
            a direct access or other file of messages to be
            used by the error handling code.
            in the event that an exi attempts
            to return control via an exit parameter to
            an err, control is instead passed to the first
            instruction in the error section (which follows the
            program section) with the error code in wa.
 
<dt>1.15 erb  int,text

<p>
 
            this instruction resembles err except that it may
            occur at any point where a branch is permitted.
            it effects a transfer of control to the error
            section with the error code in wa.

<dt>1.20 ssl  opw

<dd>         subroutine stack load

<dt>1.21 sss  opw

<dd>         subroutine stack store
<p>
 
            this pair of operations is provided to make possible
            the use of a local stack to hold subroutine (s-r)
            return links for n-type procedures. sss stores the
            s-r stack pointer in opw and ssl loads the s-r
            stack pointer from opw. by using sss in the main
            program or on entry to a procedure which should
            regain control on occurrence of an err or erb and by
            use of ssl in the error processing sections the
            s-r stack pointer can be restored giving a link
            stack cleaned up ready for resumed execution.
            the form of the link stack pointer is undefined in
            minimal (it is likely to be a private register
            known to the translator) and the only requirement
            is that it should fit into a single full word.
            ssl and sss are no-ops if a private link stack is
            not used.
<dt>1.22 rtn

<dd>              define start of routine
<p>
 
            a routine is a code chunk used for similar purposes
            to a procedure. however it is entered by any type of
            conditional or unconditional branch (not by jsr). on
            termination it passes control by a branch (often
            bri through a code word) or even permits control
            to drop through to another routine. no return link
            exists and the end of a routine is not marked by
            an explicit opcode (compare enp).
            all routines should be named in section 0
            inr  statements.

<p>
 
            the above instructions compare two address
            values as unsigned integer values.
            the blo and bhi instructions are used in cases where
            the equal condition either does not occur or can
            result either in a branch or no branch. this avoids
            inefficient translations in some implementations.

<dt>2.15 lct  w,opv

<dd>       load counter for bct
<p>
 
            lct loads a counter value for use with the bct
            instruction. the value in opv is the number of loops
            to be executed. the value in w after this operation
            is an undefined one word integer quantity.
 
<dt>2.16 bct  w,plbl

<p>
 
            bct uses the counter value in w to branch the
            required number of times and then finally to fall
            through to the next instruction. bct can only be
            used following an appropriate lct instruction.
            the value in w after execution of bct is undefined.
 
<dt>2.17 aov  opv,opn,plbl

<dt>2.18 bev  opn,plbl

<dd>     branch if even

<dt>2.19 bod  opn,plbl

<dd>     branch if odd
<p>
 
            these operations are used only if .cepp or .crpp is
            defined.  on some implementations, a more efficient
            implementation is possible by noting that address of
            blocks must always be a multiple of <code>cfp$b</code>. we call
            such addresses even.  thus return address on the
            stack (.crpp) and entry point addresses (.cepp) can
            be distinguished from block addresses if they are
            forced to be odd (not a multiple of <code>cfp$b</code>).
            bev and bod branch according as operand is even
            or odd, respectively.
<h3>3-  operations on the code pointer register (<code>CP</code>)</h3>
<p>
 
            the code pointer register provides a psuedo
            instruction counter for use in an interpretor. it
            may be implemented as a real register or as a
            memory location, but in either case it is separate
            from any other register. the value in the code
            pointer register is always a word address (i.e.
            a one word integer which is a multiple of <code>cfp$b</code>).
 
<dt>3.1  l<code>CP</code>  reg

<dd>         load code pointer register

<p> this instruction causes the code
                             pointer register to be set from
                             the value in reg which is unchanged

<dt>3.2  s<code>CP</code>  reg

<dd>         store code pointer register
                             this instruction loads the current
                             value in the code pointer register
                             into reg. (<code>CP</code>) is unchanged.
 
<dt>3.3  lcw  reg

<dd>         load next code word

<p>
                             this instruction causes the word
                             pointed to by <code>CP</code> to be loaded into
                             the indicated reg. the value in <code>CP</code>
                             is then incremented by one word.
                             execution of lcw may destroy <code>XL</code>.
 
<dt>3.4  i<code>CP</code>

<dd>              increment <code>CP</code> by one word
<p>
 
            on machines with more than three index registers,
            <code>CP</code> can be treated simply as an index register.
            in this case, the following equivalences apply.
<pre>
 
            l<code>CP</code> reg is like mov reg,<code>CP</code>
            s<code>CP</code> reg is like mov <code>CP</code>,reg
            lcw reg is like mov (<code>CP</code>)+,reg
            i<code>CP</code>     is like ica <code>CP</code>
 
</pre>
            since lcw is allowed to destroy <code>XL</code>, the following
            implementation using a work location <code>CP</code>$$$ can
            also be used.
 
<pre>
            l<code>CP</code>  reg         mov  reg,<code>CP</code>$$$
 
            s<code>CP</code>  reg         mov  <code>CP</code>$$$,reg
 
            lcw  reg         mov  <code>CP</code>$$$,<code>XL</code>
                             mov  (<code>XL</code>)+,reg
                             mov  <code>XL</code>,<code>CP</code>$$$

            produce negative zero in <code>RA</code> provided these
            instructions operate correctly with such a value.

<h3>-6-  operations on character values</h3>

<p>
 
            characte:1r operations employ the concept of a
            character pointer which uses either
            index register <code>XR</code> or <code>XL</code> (not <code>XS</code>).
 

<p>
            a character pointer points to a specific character
            in a string of characters stored <code>cfp$c</code> chars to a
            word. the only operations permitted on a character
            pointer are lch and sch. in particular, a character
            pointer may not even be moved with mov.
 

<p>
<dl>
<dt>restriction 1

<dd>
            it is important when coding in minimal to ensure
            that no action occurring between the initial use of
            plc or psc and the eventual clearing of <code>XL</code> or <code>XR</code> on
            completion of character operations can initiate a
            garbage collection. the latter of course could cause
            the addressed characters to be moved leaving the
            character pointers pointing to rubbish.
 
<dt>restriction 2.

<dd>
            a further restriction to be observed in code
            handling character strings, is that strings built
            dynamically should be right padded with zero
            characters to a full word boundary to permit easy
            hashing and use of ceq or cne in testing strings
            for equality.

<dt>6.2  psc  x,opv

<dd>       prepare char. ptr for sch,mvc,mcb.

<p>
 
            opv can be omitted if it is zero.
            the char. initially addressed is determined by the
            word address in x and the integer offset opv.
            there is an automatic implied offset of <code>cfp$f</code> bytes.
            <code>cfp$f</code> is used to formally introduce into minimal a
            value needed in translating these opcodes which,
            since minimal itself does not prescribe a string
            structure in detail, depends on the choice of a data
            structure for strings in the minimal program.
            e.g. if <code>cfp$b</code> = <code>cfp$c</code> = 3, <code>cfp$f</code> = 6, num01 = 1, <code>XL</code>
            points to a series of 4 words, abc/def/ghi/jkl, then

<dd>     load character into reg
 
<dt>6.4  sch  reg,opc

<dd>     store character from reg
 
<p>
            these operations are defined such that the character
            is right justified in register reg with zero bits to
            the left. after lch for example, it is legitimate
            to regard reg as containing the ordinal integer
            corresponding to the character.
 
            opc is one of the following three possibilities.
 
<ul>
<li>(x)  --            the character pointed to by the
                             character pointer in x. the

<li>(x)+  --             same character as (x) but the
                             character pointer is incremented
                             to point to the next character
                             following execution.
 
<li>-(x)  --             the character pointer is decre-
                             mented before accessing the
                             character so that the previous
                             character is referenced.
</ul>

<dt>6.5  csc  x

<p>
            this instruction marks completion of a
            psc,sch,sch,...,sch sequence initiated by
            a  psc  x instruction. no more sch instructions
            using  x  should be obeyed until another psc is
            obeyed. it is provided solely as an efficiency aid
            on machines without character orders since it
            permits use of register buffering of chars in sch
            sequences. where csc is not a no-op, it must observe
            restriction 2. (e.g. in spitbol, alocs zeroises the
            last word of a string frame prior to sch sequence
            being started so csc must not nullify this action.)
 
<p>
            the following instructions are used to compare
            two words containing <code>cfp$c</code> characters.
            comparisons distinct from beq,bne are provided as
            on some target machines, the possibility of the sign
            bit being set may require special action.
            note that restriction 2 above, eases use of these
            orders in testing complete strings for equality,
            since whole word tests are possible.

<p>
            cmc is used to compare two character strings. before
            executing cmc, registers are set up as follows.
<pre>
            (<code>XL</code>)             character ptr for first string
            (<code>XR</code>)             character pointer for second string
            (wa)             character count (must be .gt. zero)
</pre>

<p>
            <code>XL</code> and <code>XR</code> should have been prepared by plc.
            control passes to first plbl if the first string
            is lexically less than the second string, and to
            the second plbl if the first string is lexically
            greater. control passes to the following instruction
            if the strings are identical. after executing this
            instruction, the values of <code>XR</code> and <code>XL</code> are set to
            zero and the value in (wa) is undefined.
            arguments to cmc may be complete or partial
            strings, so making optimisation to use whole word
            comparisons difficult (dependent in general on
            shifts and masking).
 
<dt>6.9  trc

<dd>              translate characters

<p>
 
            trc is used to translate a character string using a
            supplied translation table. before executing trc the
            registers are set as follows.
<pre>
            (<code>XL</code>)             char ptr to string to be translated
            (<code>XR</code>)             char ptr to translate table
            (wa)             length of string to be translated
</pre>

<p>
            <code>XL</code> and <code>XR</code> should have been prepared by plc.
            the translate table consists of <code>cfp$a</code> contiguous
            characters giving the translations of the <code>cfp$a</code>
            characters in the alphabet. on completion, (<code>XR</code>) and
            (<code>XL</code>) are set to zero and (wa) is undefined.

<p> the above shifts are logical shifts in which bits
            shifted out are lost and zero bits supplied as

<dt>7.11 zgb  opn

<dd>         zeroise garbage bits
 
<p>
            opn contains a bit string representing a word
            of characters from a string or some function
            formed from such characters (e.g. as a result of
            hashing). on a machine where the word size is not a
            multiple of the character size, some bits in reg may
            be undefined. this opcode replaces such bits by the
            zero bit. zgb is a no-op if the word size is a
            multiple of the character size.

<h3>8-  conversion instructions</h3>
 
<p>
            the following instructions provide for conversion
            between lengths in bytes and lengths in words.
 

<dt>8.1  wtb  reg

<dd>         convert reg from words to bytes.


<p>that is, multiply by <code>cfp$b</code>. this is
                             a no-op if <code>cfp$b</code> is one.
 
<dt>8.2  btw  reg

<dd>         convert reg from bytes to words

<p> by dividing reg by <code>cfp$b</code> discarding
                             the fraction. no-op if <code>cfp$b</code> is one
 
<p>
            the following instructions provide for conversion
            of one word integer values (addresses) to and
            from the full signed integer format.
 
<dt>8.3  mti  opn

<dd>         the value of opn (an address)
                             is moved as a positive integer
                             to the integer accumulator.
 
<dt>8.4  mfi  opn,plbl

<dd>    the value currently stored in the
                             integer accumulator is moved
                             to opn as an address if it is in
                             the range 0 to <code>cfp$m</code> inclusive.
                             if the accumulator value is
                             outside this range, then the result
                             in opn is undefined and control is
                             passed to plbl. mfi destroys the
                             value of (ia) whether or not
                             integer overflow is signalled.
                             plbl may be omitted if overflow
                             is impossible.
 
<p>
            the following instructions provide for conversion
            between real values and integer values.
 
<dt>8.5  itr

<dd>              convert integer value in integer
                             accumulator to real and store in
                             real accumulator (may lose
                             precision in some cases)

<dt>8.6  rti  plbl

<dd>        convert the real value in ra to
                             an integer and place result in <code>IA</code>.
                             conversion is by truncation of the
                             fraction - no rounding occurs.
                             jump to plbl if out of range. (ra)
                             is not changed in either case.
                             plbl may be omitted if overflow
                             is impossible.
 
<p>
            the following instructions provide for computing
            the length of storage required for a text string.

<dt>8.7  ctw  w,val

<dd>       this instruction computes the sum
                             (number of words required to store
                             w characters) + (val). the sum
                             is stored in w.
                             for example, if <code>cfp$c</code> is 5, and wa
                             contains 32, then ctw wa,2
                             gives a result of 9 in wa.
 
<dt>8.8  ctb  w,val

<dd>       ctb is exactly like ctw except that
                             the result is in bytes. it has the
                             same effect as ctw w,val  wtb w
<p>
 
            the following instructions provide for conversion
            from integers to and from numeric digit characters
            for use in numeric conversion routines. they employ
            negative integer values to allow for proper
            conversion of numbers which cannot be complemented.
 

<dt>8.9  cvm  plbl

<dd>        convert by multiplication

<p>
 
            the integer accumulator, which is zero or negative,
            is multiplied by 10. <code>WB</code> contains the character
            code for a digit. the value of this digit is then
            subtracted from the result. if the result is out of
            range, then control is passed to plbl with the
            result in (<code>IA</code>) undefined. execution of cvm leaves
            the result in (<code>WB</code>) undefined.
 

<dte>8.10 cvd

<dd>              convert by division

<p>
 
            the integer accumulator, which is zero or negative,
            is divided by 10. the quotient (zero or negative)
            is replaced in the accumulator. the remainder is
            converted to the character code of a digit and
            placed in wa. for example, an operand of -523 gives
            a quotient of -52 and a remainder in wa of ch$d3.
 
<h3>9-  block move instructions</h3>

<p>
 
       the following instructions are used for transferring
       data from one area of memory to another in blocks.
       they can be implemented with the indicated series of
       other macro-instructions, but more efficient 
implementations will be possible on most machines.

<p>
 
       note that in the equivalent code sequence shown below, a
       zero value in wa will move at least one item, and may
       may wrap the counter causing a core dump in some imple-
       mentations.  thus wa should be .gt. 0 prior to invoking
       any of these block move instructions.
 
<dt>9.1  mvc

<dd>              move characters

<p>
 
            before obeying this order wa,<code>XL</code>,<code>XR</code> should have been
            set up, the latter two by plc, psc resp.
            mvc is equivalent to the sequence
<pre> 
                   mov  <code>WB</code>,dumpb
                   lct  wa,wa
            loopc  lch  <code>WB</code>,(<code>XL</code>)+
                   sch  <code>WB</code>,(<code>XR</code>)+
                   bct  wa,loopc
                   csc  <code>XR</code>
                   mov  dumpb,<code>WB</code>
 
</pre>

<p>
            the character pointers are bumped as indicated
            and the final value of wa is undefined.
 
 
<dt>9.2  mvw

<dd>              move words

<p>
 
            mvw is equivalent to the sequence
 
<pre>
            loopw  mov  (<code>XL</code>)+,(<code>XR</code>)+
                   dca  wa               wa = bytes to move
                   bnz  wa,loopw
 
</pre>

<p>
            note that this implies that the value in wa is the
            length in bytes which is a multiple of <code>cfp$b</code>.
            the initial addresses in <code>XR</code>,<code>XL</code> are word addresses.
            as indicated, the final <code>XR</code>,<code>XL</code> values point past the
            new and old regions of memory respectively.
            the final value of wa is undefined.
            wa,<code>XL</code>,<code>XR</code> must be set up before obeying mvw.
 
<dt>9.3  m<code>WB</code>

<dd>              move words backwards

<p>
 
            m<code>WB</code> is equivalent to the sequence
 
<pre>
            loopb  mov  -(<code>XL</code>),-(<code>XR</code>)
                   dca  wa               wa = bytes to move
                   bnz  wa,loopb
</pre>

<p> 
            there is a requirement that the initial value in <code>XL</code>
            be at least 256 less than the value in <code>XR</code>. this
            allows an implementation in which chunks of 256
            bytes are moved forward (ibm 360, icl 1900).
            the final value of wa is undefined.
            wa,<code>XL</code>,<code>XR</code> must be set up before obeying m<code>WB</code>.
 
<dt>9.4  mcb

<dd>

              move characters backwards

<p>
 
            mcb is equivalent to the sequence
 
<pre>
                   mov  <code>WB</code>,dumpb
                   lct  wa,wa
            loopc  lch  <code>WB</code>,-(<code>XL</code>)
                   sch  <code>WB</code>,-(<code>XR</code>)

                   csc  <code>XR</code>
                   mov  dumpb,<code>WB</code>
</pre>

<p> 
            there is a requirement that the initial value in <code>XL</code>
            be at least 256 less than the value in <code>XR</code>. this
            allows an implementation in which chunks of 256
            bytes are moved forward (ibm 360, icl 1900).
            the final value of wa is undefined.
            wa,<code>XL</code>,<code>XR</code> must be set up before obeying mcb.
 
<h3>10- operations connected with the stack</h3>

<p>
 
       the stack is an area in memory which is dedicated for use
       in conjunction with the stack pointer register (<code>XS</code>). as
       previously described, it is used by the jsr and exi
       instructions and may be used for storage of any other
       data as required.

<p>
       the stack builds either way in memory and an important
       restriction is that the value in (<code>XS</code>) must be the address
       of the stack front at all times since
       some implementations may randomly destroy stack locations
       beyond (<code>XS</code>).
<p>
 
       the starting stack base address is passed
       in (<code>XS</code>) at the start of execution. during execution it
       is necessary to make sure that the stack does not
       overflow. this is achieved by executing the following
       instruction periodically.
 

<dt>10.1 chk

<dd>              check stack overflow
 
<p>
       after successfully executing chk, it is permissible to
       use up to 100 additional words before issuing another chk
       thus chk need not be issued every time the stack is
       expanded. in some implementations, the checking may be
       automatic and chk will have no effect. following the
       above rule makes sure that the program will operate
       correctly in implementations with no automatic check.
 
<p>
       if stack overflow occurs (detected either automatically
       or by a chk instruction), then control is passed to the
       stack overflow section (see program form). note that this
       transfer may take place following any instruction which
       stores data at a new location on the stack.
       after stack overflow, stack is arbitrarily popped
       to give some space in which the error procedure may
       operate. otherwise a loop of stack overflows may occur.
 
<h3>11- data generation instructions</h3>

<p>
 
       the following instructions are used to generate constant
       values in the constant section and also to assemble
       initial values in the working storage section. they
       may not appear except in these two sections.

<dt>11.1 dac  addr

<dd>        assemble address constant.


<p>
                             generates one word containing the
                             specified one word integer
                             value (address).
 

<dt>11.2 dic  integer

<dd>     generates an integer value which
                             occupies <code>cfp$i</code> consecutive words.
                             the operand is a digit string with
                             a required leading sign.
 
<dt>11.3 drc  real

<dd>        assembles a real constant which
                             occupies <code>cfp$r</code> consecutive words.
                             the operand form must obey the
                             rules for a fortran real constant
                             with the extra requirement that a
                             leading sign be present.
<dt>11.4 dtc  dtext

<dd>       define text constant. 

<p>
text is started and ended with any character not contained in the
                             characters to be assembled. the
                             constant occupies consecutive words
                             as dictated by the configuration
                             parameter <code>cfp$c</code>. any unused chars
                             in the last word are right filled
                             with zeros (i.e. the character
                             whose internal code is zero).
                             the string contains a sequence of
                             letters, digits, blanks and any of
                             the following special characters.
                             =,$.(*)/+-
<p>
                             no other characters
                             may be used in a dtext operand.
 
<dt>11.5 dbc  val

<dd>         assemble bit string constant. 

<p>the operand is a positive integer
                             value which is interpreted in
                             binary, right justified and left
                             filled with zero bits. thus 5 would
                             imply the bit string value 00...101.

<h3>12- symbol definition instructions</h3>
 
<p>
       the following instruction is used to define symbols
       in the definitions section. it may not be used elsewhere.
 
<dt>12.1 equ  eqop

<dd>        define symbol
 
<p>
            the symbol which appears in the label field is
            defined to have the absolute value given
            by the eqop operand. a given symbol may be defined
            only once in this manner, and any symbols occuring
            in eqop must be previously defined.
<p>
 
            the following are the possibilities for eqop
 
<dl>

<dt>val 

<dd>             the indicated value is used


<dt> val+val

<dd>          the sum of the two values is used.
                             this sum must not exceed <code>cfp$m</code>
 
<dt>val-val

<dd>          the difference between the two
                             values (must be positive) is used.
 
<dt>*

<dd>                this format defines the label by
                             using a value supplied by the
                             minimal translator. values are
                             required for the
<pre>
            <code>cfp$x</code>            (configuration parameters)
            e$xxx            (environment parameters)
            ch$xx            (character codes).
</pre>

<p>
                             in order for a translator to
                             handle this format correctly the
                             definitions section must be
                             consulted for details of required
                             symbols as listed at the front of
                             the section.

<p> 
       the following instructions may be used to define symbols
       in the procedure section. they may not be used in
       any other part of the program.
 

<dt>12.2 exp

<dd>              define external procedure

<p>
 
            exp defines the symbol appearing in the label field
            to be the name of an external procedure which can be
            referenced in a subsequent jsr instruction. the
            coding for the procedure is external to the
            coding of the source program in this language.
            the code for external procedures may be
            referred to collectively as the operating system
            interface, or more briefly, osint, and will
            frequently be a separately compiled segment of code
            loaded with spitbol to produce a complete system.
 
<dt>12.3 inp  ptyp,int

<dd>    define internal procedure


<p>
 
            inp defines the symbol appearing in the label field
            to be the name of an internal procedure and gives
            its type and number of exit parameters. the label
            can be referenced in jsr instructions and
            it must appear labelling a prc instruction in the
            program section.
 
<dt>12.4 inr

<dd>              define internal routine

<p>
 
            inr defines the symbol appearing in the label
            field to be the name of an internal routine. the
            label may be referenced in any type of branch order
            and it must appear labelling a rtn instruction in
            the program section.
<h3>13- assembly listing layout instructions</h3>

<dt>13.1 ejc

<dd>              eject to next page


<dt>13.2 ttl  text

<dd>        set new assembly title


<p> ttl implies an immediate eject of the
            assembly listing to print the new title.
<p> 
            the use of ttl and ejc cards is such that the
            program will list neatly if the printer prints
            as many as 58 lines per page. in the event that
            the printer depth is less than this, or if the
            listing contains interspersed lines (such as actual
            generated code), then the format may be upset.
<p> 
            lines starting with an asterisk are comment lines
            which cause no code to be generated and may occur
            freely anywhere in the program. the format for
            comment lines is given in section -15-.
 
<h3>14- program form</h3>

<p>
 
            the program consists of separate sections separated
            by sec operations. the sections must appear in the
            following specified order.
 

<dt>14.1 sec

<pre>
            start of procedure section
 
            (procedure section)
 
            sec               start of definitions section
 
            (definitions section)
 
            sec               start of constant storage section
 
            (constant storage section)
 
            sec               start of working storage section
 
            (working storage section)
 
            sec               start of program section
 
            (program section)
 
            sec               start of stack overflow section
 
            (stack overflow section)
 
            sec               start of error section
 
            (error section)
 
</pre>

<dt>14.2 end

<dd>              end of assembly


</dl>

<h2>section 10 - program form</h2>
 
<dl>
<dt>procedure section
 
<dd>The procedure section contains all the exp
            instructions for externally available procedures
            and inp,inr opcodes for internal procedures,routines
            so that a single pass minimal translator has advance
            knowledge of procedure types when translating calls.
<p> 
<dt>definitions section
 
<dd>The definitions section contains equ instructions
            which define symbols referenced later on in the
            program, constant and work sections.
<br> 
<dt>constant storage section
<dd>The constant storage section consists entirely
            of constants assembled with the dac,dic,drc,dtc,dbc
            assembly operations. these constants can be freely
            referenced by the program instructions.
<br> 
<dt>working storage section

<dd>The working storage section consists entirely of
            dac,dic,drc,dbc,dtc instructions to define a fixed
            length work area. The work locations in this area
            can be directly referenced in program instructions.
            The area is initialized in accordance with the
            values assembled in the instructions.
<br>
<dt>program section
 
<dd>The program section contains program instructions
            and associated operations (such as prc, enp, ent).
            control is passed to the first instruction in this
            section when execution is initiated.

<dt>stack overflow section
 
<p>
<dd>The stack overflow section contains instructions
            like the program section. Control is passed to the
            first instruction in this section following the
            occurrence of stack overflow, see chk instruction.
<dt>error section

<dd>The error section contains instructions like the
            program section. control is passed to the first
            instruction in this section when a procedure exit
            corresponds to an error parameter (see err)
            or when an erb opcode is obeyed. the error code
            must clean up the main stack and cater for the
            possibility that a subroutine stack may need clean
            up.

<dt>osint
 
<dd>Though not part of the minimal source, it is useful
            to refer to the collection of initialisation and
            exp routines as osint (operating system interface).
            errors occurring within osint procedures are
            usually handled by making an error return. If this
            is not feasible or appropriate, osint may use the
            minimal error section to report errors directly by
            branching to it with a suitable numeric error
            code in wa.
 
<h2>section 11 - statement format</h2>
 
<p>All labels are exactly five characters long and start
       with three letters (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy$) followed
       by two letters or digits.
<p>
       The letter z may not be used in minimal symbols but $ is
       permitted.
<p>
       For implementations where $ may not appear in the
       target code , a simple substitution of z for $
       may thus be made without risk of producing non-unique
       symbols.
<p>
       The letter z is however permitted in opcode mnemonics and
       in comments.
 
<p>Minimal statements are in a fixed format as follows.
<pre> 
       cols 1-5              label if any (else blank)
 
       cols 6-7              always blank
 
       cols 8-10             operation mnemonic
 
       cols 11-12            blanks
 
       cols 13-28            operand field, terminated by a
                             blank. may occasionally
                             extend past column 28.
 
       cols 30-64            comment. always separated from the
                             operand field by at least one blank
                             may occasionally start after column
                             30 if the operand extends past 28.
                             a special exception occurs for the
                             iff instruction, whose comment may
                             be only 20 characters long (30-49).
 
       cols 65 on            unused
 
 
       comment lines have the following format
 
       col 1                 asterisk
 
       cols 2-7              blank
 
       cols 8-64             arbitrary text, restricted to the
                             fortran character set.
 
 
       the fortran character set is a-z 0-9 =,$.(*)-/+
</pre>
 
<h2>section 12 - program execution</h2>
 
<p>Execution of the program begins with the first
       instruction in the program section.
 
<p>In addition to the fixed length memory regions defined
       by the assembly, there are two dynamically allocated
       memory regions as follows.
 
<dl>

<dt>data area

<dd>This is an area available to the
                             program for general storage of data
                             any data value may be stored in
                             this area except instructions.
                             in some implementations, it may be
                             possible to increase the size of
                             this area dynamically by adding
                             words at the top end with a call
                             to a system procedure.
<dt>stack area
<dd>This region of memory holds
                             the stack used for subroutine calls
                             and other storage of one word
                             integer values (addresses). this
                             is the stack associated with
                             index register <code>XS</code>.
<p>The locations and sizes of these areas are specified
       by the values in the registers at the start of program
       execution as follows.
 
<dl>

<dt>(<code>XS</code>)

<dd>Address one past the stack base.
                             e.g. if <code>XS</code> is 23456, a d-stack will
                             occupy words 23455,23454,...
                             whereas a u-stack will occupy
                             23457,23458,...
 
<dt>(<code>XR</code>)

<dd>Address of the first word
                             in the data area
<dt>(<code>XL</code>)

<dd>Address of the last word in the
                             data area.
 
<dt>(wa)

<dd>Initial stack pointer

<dt> (<code>WB</code>,<code>WC</code>,<code>IA</code>,ra,<code>CP</code>)

<dd>zero
