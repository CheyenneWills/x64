Note from Mark Emmer on 9 September 2009. Attached was a tar file that
contained the starting files for this project.


Dave,

 

Here are all the source files and a makefile to build 32-bit spitbol.
Undoubtedly you'll find that you're missing some libraries and perhaps
the correct 'as'.  Let me know and I'll steer you in the right
direction.  Also included is a spitbol executable which might work
straight out of the box on your system.

 

I included v37.s and errors.s, thus you should not need a working
spitbol executable to build.

 

Let me know how it goes.  And please don't upload this source to any
public site until we decide on the license and refine it a bit more.

 

Mark
