* Platform-specific mods to codlinux.spt

* GNU C labels do not have an underscore prefix
	C.OUT = ''

* Number of statements within which a jump will be shortened.  Derived
* empirically as follows for a specific Minimal program:
*
* Set JUMP_N to a large value, then translate and assemble program.
* The assembler will report a large number of jumps out of range.
* Reduce JUMP_N until the number of errors is small (<10), and enter
* those as special cases below.
*
* These definitions are for Minimal file V37.MIN and the 80386 code generator.

	JUMP_N = 27

* Specific statements not to shorten.  Derived empirically.

	NS1 = "JNZ" *WS "INIX0"
	NS2 = "JE"  *WS "GTEX2"
	NS_PAT = *WS (NS1 | NS2)
