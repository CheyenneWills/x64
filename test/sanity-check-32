# This program does a sanity test on the 32-bit version of spitbol, to  verify that spitbol is able to compile itself.
# This is done by building the system three times, and comparing the generated assembly (.s) files. 
# Normally, all three assembly files wil be equal. However, if a new optimization is
# being introduced, the first two may differ, but the second and third should always agree.
